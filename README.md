My personal repository for all completed Katas' from the [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) site, dedicated to custom challenges. Currently my main language of study is C++, so all the challenges are done with C++ and its librarires (and STL constainers mostly, of course). Each project, mostly presented in one file, has its own task, descripted on the site for further comfort without need to look up the task.
Nothing much to tell about, just a place to save all my training process for future analyzation. **I did not add the most trivial and commonplace challenges, like this one:**
> Description. Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!". Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

And the code for it will most likely look something like that:

```
#include <string>

std::string greet() {
  return "hello world!";
}
```
There are some other examples, mostly in the Kata 8 level, and mostly about numbers multiplication, that I decided would not make much sense to store here.
**Reporsitory will be updated often, most likely, with every 5 or so completed katas', as on higher level is takes more effort to complete even some challenges and so it is worth renewing completed tasks list.**
